# TODO

## Primary
[ ] Do Clangc::CompletionString#chunk_completion_strings method

[ ] Finish Implement Clangc::Cursor methods

[ ] use rubyish methods name. All methods starting with is_something must be in ruby something?

[ ] Try to implement enum with ruby class instead of module and allow the usage of symbol instead of ruby
    Constants which is more Rubyish (see ruby-gnome2 project)

## Secondary:
[ ] See how to exclude clangc.c from modification by clang-format

[ ] Continue / improve YARD usage

[ ] Clean style
  *    Make all variables declarations at start
  *    Use space after for and if
  *    Use for spaces for indentation

[ ] Finish test case (see TODO in tests/ directory)

[ ] Optimize :
  *   When a method returns a Clangc Object
    test the returned value before creating
    a Clangc object
